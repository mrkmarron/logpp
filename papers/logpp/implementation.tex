Given the design principals outlined in \autoref{sec:implementation} we now 
present the implementation of \projn, which realizes these goals in a logger 
for the \texttt{Node.js}~\cite{Node} runtime. It is possible to implement many 
of the features needed to satisfy our design goals as a library or using the 
native API extension bindings (N-API~\cite{NAPI}) but others require core 
runtime support. For these core changes we modify the ChakraCore JavaScript 
engine and core Node implementation directly.

\subsection{Implementation Overview}
Lets do a high level archnitechture and review of the systems we build here...
