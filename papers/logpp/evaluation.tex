Lets break the evaluation down into evlauating the implementation with respect 
to each of the design goals...

\subsection{Logging Optimizations}
Lets do some microbencharks on logging and break down the impact of various 
implementation/design ideas...

multi-level impact

expando impact

\subsection{Logging Performance}
Lets do some macro benchmarks on a couple of non-micro workloads to see the 
impact in practice...

\subsection{Information Availability}
Lets compare our goals in Design Principle 3 with the implementation... 

study of detailed dump on error and bug fix?

study of simplified output log and reduction in storage/transport sizes -- 
e.g., save XXMB of traffic/storage per day kind of thing.

\subsection{Log Code Clutter}
Can we do a github search or some similar for if(...) console.log or 
is there other liturature on how developers use logs that we can 
quantify simplification benefits?

Do we have any other metrics that would be good to compare?

\subsection{Unified Logging Control}
ASDF ... we clearly can do this but not sure how to evaluate? 
Can we do some user study? Look at what happenes when I require a 
module that uses winston/pino/etc.
