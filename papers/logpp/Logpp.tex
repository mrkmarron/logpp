\begin{abstract} 
Logging is a fundamental part of the software development and
monitoring lifecycle but logging support is often provided as an afterthought 
via limited library APIs or third-party modules. We argue that given the critical
nature of logging in modern development, the unique needs of the APIs involved,
and the opportunities for optimization using semantic knowledge, logging should
be included as a central part of the language and runtime designs. This paper
presents \projn which includes support for
logging functionality at all levels of a programming language including, syntax,
runtime support, and hooks for DevOps integration.

Using this integrated approach we build a logging system that supports near
zero-cost for disabled log statements, low cost lazy-copying for enabled log
statements, selective persistence of logging output, unified control of logging
output across different libraries, and DevOps integration for use with modern
cloud-based deployments. To evaluate these concepts we provide two
implementations -- one fully integrated into the design of the \emph{fluent}
programming language and a second, which has slightly reduced features and
performance, but is available as a library for Node.js hosted JavaScript
applications.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:intro}
Logging has always been a important tool for software developers in
understanding their applications. However, as DevOps oriented workflows have
become more prevalent, logging is becoming an even larger consideration when
building applications. A key area driving this shift is the use of cloud-based
applications and the integration of application monitoring dashboards, such as
Stack Driver~\cite{StackDriver}, NSolid~\cite{NSolid}, or
AppInsights~\cite{AppInsights}, which ingest logs from an application, correlate
this information with other aspects of the system, and provide this in a useful
dashboard format for developers. The additional value provided by these
dashboards and the ability to quickly act on this data makes the inclusion of
rich logging data an integral part of an applications development.

Existing logging library implementations, as provided via core or third party
libraries, are unable to satisfactorily meet the demands of logging in modern
applications. As a result developers must use existing libraries with care to
limit undesirable logging related performance impacts and \emph{log spew}, work 
to control logging output from other modules to the appropriate channels, and figure
out how to effectively parse the data that is written from various sources.
Consider the following sample JavaScript code in~\autoref{fig:introExample} 
which illustrates concrete issues encountered by Node.js~\cite{Node} developers today.

\begin{figure*}[t]

\end{figure*}

A major issue with logging is the potential for the accidental introduction 
of serious performance problems though seemingly benign activities. In 
existing logging framework even if a given logging level is disabled, 
as \texttt{debug} and \texttt{trace} levels usually are, the code to generate 
and format the log message is still executed. This can either be due to eager 
evaluation semantics of the source language or due to limitations in compiler 
optimizations for dead-code elemination in languages with workarounds such as 
macros. This results in code that looks like it will not be executed but that in 
reality incurs large parasitic costs and can be seen in the \texttt{logger.debug} 
statement in the example, which at the default level does not print to the log, but will
still result in the creation of the literal object and generation of a format
string on every execution of the loop. This cost leads developers to defensively
remove these statements from code instead of depending on the runtime to
eliminate their costs when deploying the application.

Next is the issue of \emph{log spew} where logging at a detailed level, which 
may be desireable for debugging when an issue occours, fills the log with 
large quantities of uninteresting noise output. An example of this is the 
\texttt{logger.info} message about the args and result of the \texttt{check} 
call. In the case of a successful execution the content of this log statement 
is not interesting and the cost of producing this plus the increased noise in 
the logfile is pure overhead. However, if the \texttt{check} statement fails 
then having this information about what events led up to the failure may be 
critical in diagnosing/fixing the issue. In current logging frameworks this is 
an unavoidable conundrum and, in any case where the trace history is needed, 
the logging statements must be added and the cost/noise accepted as a cost.

The combination of verbose logging and the trend towards including critical, but 
extensive, metadata such as timestamps and host information in log messages further 
drives concerns about the performance of logging. Computing a timestamp or a 
hostname string is inexpensive but the cost of formatting them into a message is 
non-trivial can can add up over thousands or millions of log messages resulting 
in unexpected performance degradations. 

Modern developer practices around logging frequently involve post processing 
of log data into analysis framework like Kusto~\cite{} or SPLUNK~\cite{}. 
However, free form specification of message formats, as seen in \emph{printf} or 
concatenated value styles, are not ammenable to machine parsing. Modern logging 
frameworks, log4j~\cite{log4j}, Winston~\cite{Winston}, Bunyan~\cite{Bunyan}, etc. 
provide some support for consistently formatting ans structuring output but
fundamentally this problem is left as a problem development teams need to solve
via coding conventions and reviews.

The final issue we consider is the growing pain of integrating multiple software 
modules, each of which may use a different form of logging. In our running example 
we have \texttt{console.log} writing to the \texttt{stdout} and a
popular framework called \texttt{Winston} which has been configured to write to
a file. As a result some log output will appear on the console while other
output will end up in a file. Further, if a developer changes the logging output
level for \texttt{Winston}, from say \texttt{info} to \texttt{warn}, this will
not change the output level of the \texttt{console} output. Developers can work
around this to some degree by enforcing the use of a single logging framework
for their code but they will not always be able to control the frameworks used
by external libraries.

To address these issues we propose an approach where logging is viewed as a first 
class feature in the design/implementation of a programming language and runtime 
instead of simply another library to be included. Taking this view enables us to 
leverage language semantics, focused compiler optimizations, and semantic knowledge 
in the runtime to provide a uniform and high performance logging API.

\noindent
The contributions of this paper include:
\begin{itemize}
\item The view that logging is a fundamental aspect of programming and should be
included as a first class part of language, compiler, and runtime design.

\item A novel logging technique that uses immutability semantics in the
programming language to enable ultra-low cost logging which is
YY$\times$-ZZ$\times$ faster than existing approaches.

\item A novel dual-level approach to log generation and writing that allows a
programmer to log execution data eagerly but only pay the cost of writting it to
the log if it turns out to be interesting/relevant.

\item A suite of innovative log format and log level management techniques that 
provide a consistent and unified log output that is easy to manage and feed into 
other tooling.

\item An implementation in Node.js with the ChakraCore~\cite{NodeChakraCore} 
JavaScript engine to demonstrate that key ideas can be applied to existing
languages/runtimes and provide an production implementation for use in
performance evaluations.
